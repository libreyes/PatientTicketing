Patient Ticketing Module
========================

This module is intended to provide a generic ticketing mechanism to track patients through multiple pathways. As a standalone module, it will require other modules to integrate with it to create patient tickets. In its first iteration it is intended to support Virtual Clinics, but it is being implemented in a way to be suitable for clinic tracking, application processing and (hopefully) any other pathway that might occur for a patient.

This module is currently under development and has no stable releases
